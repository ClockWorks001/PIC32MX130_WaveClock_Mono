# PIC32MX130F Speaking Clock Project.
---
This is a wave player  project with PIC32MX130 micro controller.
It can speak a "time" by using wave files which are stored in a SD card. 
And it also can play music wave files.

## Prerequisites

I created this project using the free versions of the following tools:
 * [Microchip MPLAB X][2] (v3.35)
 * [Microchip XC32 Compiler][3] (v1.3)
 * [EAGLE][6] (v4.0.1)

You will need to download and install these tools appropriately before you
can open this project and build it.
I use the [Microchip MPLAB PICkit3 In-Circuit Debugger][5] to program the chip and debug it.  

Also, I use the [EAGLE][6] to draw the electric circuit schematic.
